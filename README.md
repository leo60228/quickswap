# quickswap

Small mod for HIVESWAP: ACT 2 that adds the following functionality, all of which is bound to the left control key:

* Walk much faster
* Skip prerendered cutscenes
* Skip all text after a single frame (like in Pesterquest/Friendsim)
  * This can cause softlocks in a few places, especially the trial. I'm not considering this a bug, as the same thing happens when using an autoclicker.

## Installation
1. Install BepInEx ([official instructions](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/)).
2. Extract the mod so that a `BepInEx/plugins/quickswap` folder exists.
3. Start the game with BepInEx.
